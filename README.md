# SandSimulation
We've created a Java-based sand simulation with interactive features. Users can add sand to the canvas, adjust the addition radius, and watch particles fall realistically due to gravity. The simulation is represented by `SandParticle` classes, and rendering is done in `DrawCanvas`.
